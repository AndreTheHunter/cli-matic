## TO DO

- Version
- Help 
- Candidates for mistypes
- Tests for nested sub-commands
- Docs
- Rename obsolete specs
- Remove useless functions from core (and maybe otherwise as well)
- Test: core_test: check-cfg-format
- Test: help_gen_test: all
- Test: specs - with examples and failing ones
- Core: assert-cfg-sanity / can we use spec instead?
- Using functions for help


## TO TEST

- Automatic conversion of cfg to v2 when needed
- Spec: no positional arguments on branch nodes


## DONE
