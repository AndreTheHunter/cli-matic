# Contribuiting to CLI-matic

Thanks for taking your time to help CLI-matic grow!

## Feature requests

To make sure we are on the same page, please take the following steps:

* Write a description that contains:
  - What the new feature will do
  - Why it is useful (at least to you) and what are the use cases
  - If there are added dependencies
  - If it works in CLJ or CLJS or both.
* As we are talking about CLI handling, it would be nice to have examples
  of how the new feature will behave when invoked from the command line.


## Patches

* Before you submit a patch, make sure that you have a feature request (so we know what we are talking about)
* The patch should contain:
  - Code changed, propery formatted
  - Tests, properly formatted
  - If relevant (new feature), a patch for README or relevant docs
  - An usage example under `examples` and `examples-cljs-planck`
  - a CHANGELOG entry
* Code should be formatted as in Deploy.md

## Bugs

* When submitting a bug, make sure that you have a replication example and what is wrong/expected with it - 
  so we can possibly create a test out of your example.
* As CLI-matic is very compact, a 20-line script that I can run and shows the error will make the 
  fix easier.
